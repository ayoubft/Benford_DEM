# Benford_DEM

## Application of Benford's law to quality assessment of DEMs

**[Benford's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)**, also called the **Newcomb–Benford law**, the **law of anomalous numbers**, or the **first-digit law**, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30 % of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5 % of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1 % of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.
